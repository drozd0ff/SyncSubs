2
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:01,667
Good morning, sinners.

3
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:04,930
I can say that because
I'm a sinner, too.

4
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:08,140
I know the dark path
of drink and debauchery.

5
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:09,608
I traveled it well.

6
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:13,078
Yeah, but now I'm on
the path to God's light.

7
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,898
And I invite every last
one of you to come along.

8
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,399
All are welcome.

9
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:19,519
Black, white, sinner or Saint.

10
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:21,779
Even you papists.

11
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,531
All are welcome in God's house.

12
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:26,793
Thank you, Father.
I mean, Reverend.

13
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:30,030
I'm glad our dear sweet
mother wasn't here to see that.

14
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:32,249
What?
Just being polite.

15
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,135
Why you always on me arse?

16
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,939
The house was half-full last night.

17
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:42,141
Be half again tomorrow.

18
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:44,343
What do you want me to do about it?

19
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:48,013
Worry about it like I do.

20
00:05:48,138 --> 00:05:49,474
The Swede will
come calling, you know,

21
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,560
sooner rather than later.

22
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,853
That must be the new girl.

23
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:56,356
The savage one.

24
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,656
What do you mean?

25
00:05:57,781 --> 00:05:59,191
Haven't ya heard?

26
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:01,794
Mr. Toole told me the whole story.

27
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,864
She was but a girl, white as we,

28
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,241
taken captive years ago.

29
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,369
Sold to the highest
Heathen bidder, she was.

30
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,306
Some say she was a slave.

31
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:16,143
Others claim she be
an Indian princess.

32
00:06:16,268 --> 00:06:18,253
Would you stop with your tall tales.

33
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,088
She's just a whore, Mick.

34
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,923
Well, then go talk
to her, you bastard.

35
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:24,134
Make me a liar.

36
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,469
Go on.

37
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:35,145
Ahem.

38
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:41,651
Good morning to ya.

39
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,639
He buy the man a drink
first, that's what I hear.

40
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:13,568
He buy the man a drink,

41
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:14,970
take him out and goes savage
as a meat axe on him.

42
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:16,186
You hear me?

43
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,373
He didn't kill Johnson.

44
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:19,731
They was gonna hang him.

45
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,910
They didn't.

46
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:23,503
Yet.

47
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,726
Good day, Mr. Bohannon, sir.

48
00:07:36,851 --> 00:07:38,419
A fine day, is it not?

49
00:07:39,788 --> 00:07:41,998
Fine or not...

50
00:07:42,123 --> 00:07:45,668
Guess we got a good
day's work ahead of us.

51
00:07:45,793 --> 00:07:48,218
Mr. Kretschmar...

52
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,888
I need that rail-end leveled
down to the next marker.

53
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:56,378
Mr. Toole, I need you and your men
down at the end of the iron.

54
00:07:56,503 --> 00:07:57,946
Looks like the train's bringing down

55
00:07:58,071 --> 00:07:59,414
that load of ties, all right?

56
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:00,875
Yes, sir, Mr. Bohannon, sir.

57
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,352
Elam, I need you and your men...

58
00:08:03,477 --> 00:08:05,144
It's Mr. Ferguson.

59
00:08:09,216 --> 00:08:10,865
Elam...

60
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:15,370
You and your men get down to the cut.

61
00:08:17,746 --> 00:08:21,084
I need men...

62
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,838
Men not afraid of the Heathens,

63
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:27,966
men not afraid of making some money.

64
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:31,380
What is this about?

65
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:35,818
The fair-haired maiden of the West.

66
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:40,655
Mrs. Lily Bell,
she has been taken captive

67
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,726
by the Cheyenne dog soldiers.

68
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:46,818
A Mr. Durant has promised a bounty

69
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,064
to the men who rescue her.

70
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:51,322
Ain't nobody going nowhere's...

71
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:54,742
Or there won't be a job waiting
for you when you get back.

72
00:08:56,196 --> 00:09:00,409
Dix will take a party
North, Bolan, South.

73
00:09:00,534 --> 00:09:03,793
You... you...

74
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,080
You.

75
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:07,383
I told you.
I can't spare these men.

76
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:10,091
Mr. Durant wants her found.

77
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:12,385
Mr. Durant wants a railroad built.

78
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:16,958
You and you.

79
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,292
No, this ain't happening.

80
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,685
Boss man, let 'em go.

81
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,457
We can do their work and our work.

82
00:09:29,294 --> 00:09:32,030
You get your men and you
get the hell out of here.

83
00:09:41,307 --> 00:09:44,375
One more thing...

84
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,421
I'm looking for a man named Harper,

85
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:51,049
Frank Harper,
he's a friend of Johnson's.

86
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,496
I got something for him.

87
00:09:53,621 --> 00:09:55,845
I believe he's out
with the logging crew.

88
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,967
Where's that?

89
00:09:58,092 --> 00:10:01,495
Oh, must be 15, 20 miles
West of the cut by now.

90
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:09,692
Is that a bullet?

91
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:11,152
What?

92
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:13,841
What you got for sergeant Harper?

93
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,494
Ain't you got some work to do...

94
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,916
Yours and theirs?

95
00:10:23,185 --> 00:10:24,828
Get to it.

96
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:39,477
The people, they are scared.

97
00:10:39,602 --> 00:10:42,267
The Indian massacre.

98
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,582
They seen the bodies,

99
00:10:44,707 --> 00:10:47,351
heard the stories, your stories.

100
00:10:47,476 --> 00:10:49,687
I need troops.

101
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:52,089
7 men we lost last night.

102
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:54,195
Left the employ of the Union Pacific,

103
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:56,294
some on the train,
others just run off.

104
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:58,796
More tonight, I'd expect.

105
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:02,968
Seems the men prefer to keep
their scalps on their heads.

106
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:04,869
Are you afraid?
No, sir, Mr. Du...

107
00:11:04,994 --> 00:11:06,171
What about you?

108
00:11:06,296 --> 00:11:07,706
Well, as a matter of fact, I...

109
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:11,810
Enough. Now, why do you
wanna s on my railroad?

110
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:15,647
Uh, well, under our current pace,

111
00:11:15,772 --> 00:11:17,969
uh, we won't make the 40-mile mark.

112
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,318
So, what I would, uh,

113
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:22,265
propose is we straighten the route.

114
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,458
The route remains the same.

115
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,293
But Mr. Durant, as I understand it,

116
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:28,895
the deadline has been pushed up.

117
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,730
And in light of Central Pacific's
recent advances...

118
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:33,533
Keep to the plan.
I'll make it a reality.

119
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:35,926
Yes, sir, Mr. Durant.

120
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,576
You're amused?

121
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,277
No, sir.

122
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,680
I'm just looking forward
to watching yet again

123
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:51,518
as you smite the forces agin you.

124
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:53,546
The search continues?

125
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,780
For the maps?

126
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:59,552
For the woman, Lily Bell.

127
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:04,557
I've got my men
out despite Mr. Bohannon.

128
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,868
Still more concerned about
your killer than my railroad?

129
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,169
No, sir.

130
00:12:09,294 --> 00:12:11,839
But whoever cut
Daniel Johnson's throat

131
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,908
is an ongoing concern.

132
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:18,303
More importantly,
is my new foreman building my railroad?

133
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,948
He is.

134
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,919
Yet there is something about the man

135
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,522
that does not quite add up.

136
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:32,060
To... Jordan Crane, Washington, D.C.

137
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:35,797
Stop.
Honorable Senator.

138
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:39,342
Work continues at a fever pace. Stop.

139
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:44,571
However, hostile native
action threatens progress.

140
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:48,641
Stop. The march of
civilization in jeopardy.

141
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:50,776
Stop.

142
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:54,980
To heal the nation we
must displace the savage.

143
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:56,381
Stop.

144
00:12:56,506 --> 00:13:00,585
Otherwise, the savage
will displace us.

145
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,110
Mrs. Bell?

146
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:05,114
Mrs. Bell?

147
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:09,686
Whoa, boy.

148
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,272
You speak English?

149
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,606
Yes, sir.

150
00:13:35,772 --> 00:13:38,416
Move.

151
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:48,035
Who are you?

152
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,837
Joseph Black Moon.

153
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,271
You Cheyenne?

154
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:52,415
Christian.

155
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,609
Whoa, whoa.

156
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,003
Hold steady.

157
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,313
I'm unarmed, sir.

158
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:01,580
What did you do to her?

159
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:03,215
I... I didn't...

160
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,551
Hey. What did you do to her?

161
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:07,285
I saved her.

162
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,054
From the Indians?

163
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:10,558
Yes, sir.

164
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,991
She took an arrow to the shoulder.

165
00:14:13,116 --> 00:14:16,951
I'm trying to take her to
the railroad to see the doctor.

166
00:14:31,102 --> 00:14:32,622
When this happen?

167
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,081
2, maybe 3 days ago.

168
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:36,283
All right.

169
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,976
My horse, there's a field
kit in the saddle bag.

170
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,805
Here.

171
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:52,621
Hold her down.

172
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,037
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

173
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,789
Hold her down.

174
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:20,545
Hey, shh. Stop!

175
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:22,505
Stop it!

176
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:37,497
Hold on.

177
00:15:41,268 --> 00:15:43,436
Ohh! Ohh!

178
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:10,332
Now, the man say we gotta
do our work and theirs.

179
00:16:10,457 --> 00:16:17,184
Ha! But I ask ya, why ain't
that negro ass down here with us?

180
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,645
Y'all know who he is,
that's all I'm saying.

181
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:24,078
Back in the day...
Them days was bad.

182
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:25,943
Don't get me wrong.

183
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:28,154
Massah drove me hard.

184
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,418
Nearly drove me to the grave.

185
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:33,492
You hear me?

186
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:35,286
Some things was better back then.

187
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,924
At least you knew your place.

188
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:38,581
Psalms!

189
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:42,087
Less talk, more work.

190
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,437
Bust me some stone, negro.

191
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,343
How 'bout I bust me your head?

192
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:56,140
You got something to say to me?

193
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,308
Yes, I do.

194
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,750
What would that be?

195
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,686
How come we got to do
the white man work, huh?

196
00:17:02,811 --> 00:17:07,057
Oh, that's right, 'cause you
think you is the white man,

197
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,780
not the high yellar house n you is.

198
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,514
We got to do their work and our work.

199
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,351
But this ain't for them.

200
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,262
This is for us.

201
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:45,481
White man ain't gonna
give you nothin'

202
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,110
because they want us to fall.

203
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,761
They all want us to fall.

204
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:47,294
Hey.

205
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,837
Sir? Are you leaving?

206
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,840
Yeah. Somewheres I gotta be.

207
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,926
Thank you for helping her.

208
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:58,597
Yep.

209
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,205
Whoa.

210
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,877
Damn it.

211
00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:21,827
You ain't thought this
thing through, have you?

212
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,370
What do you mean?

213
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:25,665
Indian brings that
woman back to town,

214
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,734
Indian don't get out alive.

215
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:32,604
But I live there, at the church.

216
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:34,298
You don't get it, do ya, boy?

217
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:38,135
They brought them back in
yesterday on a buckboard.

218
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:40,236
Everybody's seen what
they did to them bodies.

219
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:44,683
Why cut 'em up?

220
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,685
Huh?

221
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,821
What do you people get out of it?

222
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:50,940
Your people have done much worse.

223
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,452
Yeah, maybe...

224
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:58,999
Maybe.

225
00:19:59,124 --> 00:20:01,268
But I ain't gonna keep 'em

226
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:02,536
from skinning your ass alive,

227
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:05,996
you bring that white
woman back to town.

228
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,136
I'll have to take her.

229
00:20:41,534 --> 00:20:44,678
Explain to me how
I work harder than them

230
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:48,081
and they go to bed with 3 more
dollars in their pocket than I do.

231
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,149
That don't make a lick of sense.

232
00:20:50,274 --> 00:20:51,484
Well, it don't.

233
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:53,652
We work as hard as them, right?

234
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:56,155
Damn right.

235
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,116
Then why don't we get
the same reward?

236
00:21:02,152 --> 00:21:03,804
You crazy.

237
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,413
We deserve a taste, too.
Huh?

238
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:08,601
We can't go in there.

239
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,937
You ain't one of them
Nancy boys, is you, psalms?

240
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,572
Now, I know you get horny,

241
00:21:13,697 --> 00:21:15,399
I hear you back behind
that tent every night.

242
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,778
Damn, boy, you gonna go blind.

243
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:22,660
Heh heh heh.

244
00:21:22,785 --> 00:21:25,451
Look here, you go in there,

245
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,995
you coming out on
the bad end of a rope.

246
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,165
You ain't scared, is ya?

247
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,417
You're damn right I'm scared.

248
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,754

Same as me, he says.

256

My shoulder's getting much better.

279
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,588
Where's Joseph?

280
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:08,856
He took off.

281
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,124
Why?

282
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:13,594
Ma'am, it is way
too late and way too wet

283
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:17,322
to be trying to figure out
some Indian, all right?

284
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:23,037
I regret we haven't
been properly introduced.

285
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:25,239
Cullen Bohannon.

286
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:28,433
I work for the railroad.

287
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,689
Have I done something?

288
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:45,793
It ain't what you
done, it's who you are.

289
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,402
What do you mean?

290
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:52,433
You ain't whore nor squaw.

291
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,192
You shouldn't be out here.

292
00:24:56,062 --> 00:25:01,166
You don't know who I am
or what I'm capable of.

293
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:03,800
No, I don't, and I sure
as hell don't care.

294
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:30,660
Request for military support
to be taken under advisement.

295
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:37,310
Very concerned regarding
lack of progress.

296
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:43,149
Need to understand
impact of surveyor loss.

297
00:25:43,274 --> 00:25:46,218
Hmm.

298
00:25:46,343 --> 00:25:50,856
The honorable Senator
is very concerned.

299
00:25:50,981 --> 00:25:56,305
If he were in my shoes,
he'd be downright suicidal.

300
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,530
Ahh.

301
00:25:59,655 --> 00:26:02,166
Damn.

302
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:05,059
Henri?

303
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,817
Your look of disdain reminds me

304
00:26:20,942 --> 00:26:23,123
of my dear wife back in New York.

305
00:26:25,113 --> 00:26:31,129
What Hannah failed to
grasp is that where most

306
00:26:31,254 --> 00:26:37,002
men seek the warm glow that
only whisky can provide,

307
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:42,276
I imbibe to fuel a conflagration.

308
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:47,547
There's a fire in my belly
which must be fed.

309
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:51,075
Otherwise, we'll
never see the Pacific.

310
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,328
And... did your wife accept

311
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,121
this excuse, Monsieur Durant?

312
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:06,724
As a matter of fact, she didn't.

313
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:34,529
Ahh.

314
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:02,157
Sorry, mate, uh, you missed
the last show, I'm afraid.

315
00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:05,494
Oh, very well. I see.

316
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:10,365
Mr. Durant, sir,
an honor and a pleasure.

317
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,268
This is quite
an establishment you've got here.

318
00:28:13,393 --> 00:28:15,170
I'm only sorry you're
closed for the night.

319
00:28:15,295 --> 00:28:17,339
The next show begins
at dusk tomorrow.

320
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:18,947
Quiet, you daft bastard.

321
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:22,009
This is Thomas "Doc" Durant.

322
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:25,112
A private view he'll be having.

323
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:26,847
Thank you.

324
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:28,081
Ah, how much?

325
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:29,916
Ah, that will be 5...

326
00:28:30,082 --> 00:28:31,351
Dollars.

327
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:35,646
The going rate...
For a private show.

328
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:43,930
Mickey, show time!

329
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:54,473
I have followed your exploits

330
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:58,945
and investments since
I got off the boat.

331
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,948
How you rose up from nothing,

332
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,419
pulled yourself up
by your bootstraps.

333
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:09,557
You're a gentlemen
and a true capitalist.

334
00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:11,849
Thank you.

335
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:19,566
Hmm.

336
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:24,513
I assume you two are immigrants
from this beautiful country?

337
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,439
Aye.

338
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,843
From county Wicklow, to be exact.

339
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,521
We left our sweet mother
and 4 brothers

340
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,941
and set out for the new
world to seek our fortune.

341
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,945
You left a beautiful life

342
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:45,659
to come and wallow in this
filth and squalor and muck.

343
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,120
Well, it beats starving to death.

344
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,466
No, but you could have remained

345
00:29:51,591 --> 00:29:53,368
in New York or Boston or Chicago.

346
00:29:53,493 --> 00:29:55,043
There's plenty of work to be had.

347
00:29:55,209 --> 00:30:00,443
Yet you chose to come here.

348
00:30:00,568 --> 00:30:03,093
It makes me wonder why.

349
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:09,558
I'm not quite sure
what you mean, sir.

350
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:13,624
Well, you and thousands like you

351
00:30:13,749 --> 00:30:19,363
have followed me out here,
and I'm genuinely curious.

352
00:30:19,488 --> 00:30:20,652
Why?

353
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:24,568
Well, sir, um...

354
00:30:24,693 --> 00:30:27,537
It seemed a proper investment

355
00:30:27,662 --> 00:30:30,620
of our time and efforts.

356
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:32,574
That's not it at all.

357
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:35,677
I remember it well...
Like it was yesterday.

358
00:30:35,802 --> 00:30:37,169
What are you talking about?

359
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,712
What is it you remember?

360
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:45,052
Ahem. We were just lads, me and Sean,

361
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,087
never been much further afield

362
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:50,849
than the bitter land our father worked,
God rest him.

363
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,519
And one day, we heard the whistle.

364
00:30:54,685 --> 00:31:00,558
And it was the Dublin
special on its daily run.

365
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:05,947
Well, we jumped the steaming bastard.

366
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:08,944
It took us all the way to the city.

367
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:10,513
Ha ha ha.

368
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:14,684
Yes, I remember.

369
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:17,417
I never felt so free.

370
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,420
The railroad, it gave you freedom.

371
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:22,561
Aye.

372
00:31:22,686 --> 00:31:28,261
And our father...
Gave us the whipping of a lifetime.

373
00:31:58,753 --> 00:32:01,253
I prayed you'd stay away, my son.

374
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,340
This is my home.

375
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,569
It's not a very safe one right now

376
00:32:07,694 --> 00:32:11,429
for one born out of the Grace of God.

377
00:32:11,595 --> 00:32:14,224
But I'm baptized, Father.

378
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,061
Yeah, well, that does not always sway

379
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,873
the cruel prejudice of others.

380
00:32:27,382 --> 00:32:29,259
It's not your fault.

381
00:32:29,384 --> 00:32:30,827
But it is.

382
00:32:30,952 --> 00:32:33,618
They were from my band.

383
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:38,659
Our dog soldiers,
they're the ones that did this.

384
00:32:40,095 --> 00:32:43,040
Your family had nothing
to do with this.

385
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:47,176
I recognize the arrows, Father.

386
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:49,843
It was my brother.

387
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:56,850
You must tell no one.

388
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,923
Never speak of this again.

389
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:02,522
But it's the truth.

390
00:33:04,753 --> 00:33:06,318
Never.

391
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:57,410
Well, there you are, kitty cat.

392
00:33:57,576 --> 00:33:59,329
What do you want?

393
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,251
Oh, we want you.

394
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:03,253
We've been searching
over hill and Dale

395
00:34:03,378 --> 00:34:05,960
for the fair-haired
maiden of the West.

396
00:34:06,126 --> 00:34:07,962
We come to rescue ya.

397
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,215
Thank you, no.
I'm quite all right.

398
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,716
No, you ain't.

399
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:14,469
You barely escaped massacre.

400
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,800
You've been held captive.

401
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:19,369
You've been sullied by the Heathen.

402
00:34:19,494 --> 00:34:21,017
You're out of order, sir.

403
00:34:21,183 --> 00:34:22,473
Listen, you ain't come with us,

404
00:34:22,598 --> 00:34:25,480
we ain't get compensated.

405
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:32,007
Oh, yeah, there's a bounty on
your head now, 100 gold eagles.

406
00:34:33,612 --> 00:34:35,156
Go ahead.

407
00:34:40,082 --> 00:34:43,039
Easy now, girl.
You just take it easy.

408
00:34:43,205 --> 00:34:44,829
Stay back.
Easy now.

409
00:34:44,954 --> 00:34:46,564
Stay back!

410
00:34:46,689 --> 00:34:48,920
Now, you making this a lot more
unpleasant than it has to be.

411
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,800
Aah!

412
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:02,603
Uhh!

413
00:35:05,102 --> 00:35:06,540
Uhh!

414
00:35:15,116 --> 00:35:16,883
Mrs. Bell!

415
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:19,818
Damn it.

416
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:23,931
Come on!

417
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:27,835
My ear!

418
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,670
My ear! My ear!

419
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,295
Where is it?

420
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:35,500
Whoa. Whoa, hold up there.

421
00:36:28,727 --> 00:36:32,062
Death is no stranger
to this God-forsaken place.

422
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:39,280
Death abides in the hard
labor of a rail gang

423
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:42,016
or the searing heat
of a prairie fire.

424
00:36:42,141 --> 00:36:45,745
Death abides at the bottom
of a whisky bottle

425
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:47,423
or at the smoking end of a gun.

426
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,426
There's death by famine, flood,

427
00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:52,762
or pestilence, and
a thousand other ways.

428
00:36:52,887 --> 00:36:54,546
But yes, brothers,

429
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:59,726
death abides and he will
reap his dark harvest.

430
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:07,810
But must we be death's accomplice?

431
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:11,271
Must we do his bidding?

432
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:17,220
I know that your
hearts seek vengeance

433
00:37:17,345 --> 00:37:20,825
for the deaths of
those men, I know that,

434
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:26,064
but haven't we had our fill of war,

435
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,747
our fill of killing,
the shedding of blood?

436
00:37:39,336 --> 00:37:41,949
And they will hammer their swords

437
00:37:42,074 --> 00:37:44,141
into plowshares...

438
00:37:46,345 --> 00:37:50,424
And their Spears into pruning hooks.

439
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,961
Nations will not lift up
swords against nations.

440
00:37:54,271 --> 00:38:00,324
And never again will
they learn war. Never again.

441
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:08,532
Isaiah, chapter 2, verse 4.

442
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:13,112
Wake up the mighty men,

443
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:16,884
let all the men of war draw near.

444
00:38:17,009 --> 00:38:21,055
Hammer your plowshares into swords

445
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,820
and your pruning hooks into Spears.

446
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:29,432
Job, chapter 3, verse 10.

447
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:34,001
I, too, am sick of war, Reverend.

448
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:42,810
But we must consistently ask
ourselves what is worth fighting for?

449
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:48,206
What is worth laying our
lives on the line for?

450
00:38:51,717 --> 00:38:54,874
Robert Bell gave his life
for this undertaking.

451
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,028
For this grand idea,
and I assure you,

452
00:39:00,153 --> 00:39:02,664
he did not give his life in vain,

453
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:05,634
for he knew what this railroad

454
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:08,503
would mean to us as a nation.

455
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:13,175
He knew this railroad is
a new birth of freedom.

456
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:17,145
Not just the freedom
of long distance travel,

457
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:20,382
but the freedom to choose your fate,

458
00:39:20,732 --> 00:39:23,852
the freedom to make
your fortunes in this untamed land.

459
00:39:23,977 --> 00:39:28,023
And we cannot let
that freedom be threatened

460
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:34,027
by rag-tag bands of marauding
stone age primitives.

461
00:39:35,189 --> 00:39:42,588
But that is not to say
that there is not a peaceful solution.

462
00:39:42,754 --> 00:39:46,409
If they will put down their sticks

463
00:39:46,534 --> 00:39:50,146
and stones and come into the fold,

464
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:54,041
like this young man here...

465
00:39:55,277 --> 00:39:57,988
Then we will talk peace.

466
00:39:58,113 --> 00:40:03,561
Now, look at him...
Wearing our clothes,

467
00:40:03,686 --> 00:40:06,596
speaking our language,

468
00:40:06,945 --> 00:40:12,292
washed in the blood of our savior.

469
00:40:13,895 --> 00:40:20,609
If these violent nomads
roaming the plains

470
00:40:20,734 --> 00:40:22,577
are willing to do as he has done,

471
00:40:23,364 --> 00:40:25,413
then there is very real hope

472
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:30,384
that our mission might be
accomplished peacefully.

473
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,388
If not...

474
00:40:34,513 --> 00:40:40,563
Then they are the authors
of their own destruction.

475
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:24,899
It's been months since
I've seen such a...

476
00:41:25,564 --> 00:41:27,805
S hole?

477
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:30,106
Whoa.

478
00:41:30,231 --> 00:41:32,576
Will you be all right from here?

479
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:36,202
You're not taking me in?

480
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:40,274
The church and the Doctor
straight on up ahead.

481
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,652
Wait.

482
00:41:42,777 --> 00:41:44,043
What about the bounty?

483
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:46,255
I told ya,

484
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:51,160
I got business to attend
to in Cheyenne territory.

485
00:41:51,285 --> 00:41:53,095
I got about 4 hours of daylight left.

486
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,222
I gotta move.

487
00:41:57,992 --> 00:42:00,560
Mr. Bohannon?

488
